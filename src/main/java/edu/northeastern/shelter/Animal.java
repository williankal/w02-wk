/**
 * One animal in the shelter's care, as recorded at intake.
 *
 * <p>This is the class you build in this lab, and it is the class the rest of the term is built on.
 * Everything about it is deliberate:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Every field is {@code private final}.</strong> Nothing outside this class can see
 *       them, and nothing — including this class — can change them after construction.
 *   <li><strong>There are no setters.</strong> An animal's intake record is a statement about what
 *       happened. If a fact changes, that is a new record, not an edit to history.
 *   <li><strong>The constructor validates.</strong> An {@code Animal} that exists is an {@code
 *       Animal} that makes sense. No method further down the line has to wonder whether the name is
 *       blank.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Two things are <em>deliberately missing</em>, and you should not add them: this class has no
 * {@code equals}/{@code hashCode} and no ordering. Comparing animals turns out to be subtler than
 * it looks, and it gets a lab of its own. For now, two separately-constructed animals with identical
 * fields are simply two different objects.
